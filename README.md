# SeedChecker 1.17.1

## Install Instructions

Due to technical and legal limitations, we can't publish our project with mapped minecraft code, so this project will require a few setup steps.  
1: clone this repository: https://github.com/jellejurre/yarn  
2: open a terminal in the cloned folder   
3: type "gradlew publishToMavenLocal"   
4: clone this SeedChecker repository  
5: code in this repository (sadly, publishing it and importing it will remove class names, which is possible to work with, but very difficult)
